    <h2>Vivari AI Corp</h2>
    <p>Co-founder, Oct 2023-now</p>
    <p class="tech">OpenAI API, HuggingFace, Qdrant, RAG, PyTorch, ollama, vllm, Rust, Next.js</p>
    <p>
    Vivari aims to be an alternative to Langchain in Rust. This is my passion project
    and I have been streaming my development of this project on Youtube 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@vagmi/streams">streams</a>. Since this place has become too crowded and 
    OpenAI released their Assistants API, I have started to focus on other aspects of LLM integrations. I learnt
    a ton of stuff about LLMs, RAG, function calling, Vector Embeddings and orchestrating LLM API 
    calls with OpenAI and serving models locally with ollama or vllm.

    <h2 class="glitch">Tarka Labs, A division of Sedin Technologies</h2>
    <p>CTO & Co-founder, 2014-now</p>
    <p>
      I‚Äòve built this division into a vibrant team worldwide. I hired engineers, 
      designers, product managers and sales both in Canada, US, Poland and
      India. While I have provided technical and strategic guidance on most 
      projects at Tarka Labs, I have hands-on contribution in the 
      following projects. 
    </p>
    <h2>&gt; Innovation Projects</h2>
    <p>
    I lead all the innovation projects in Sedin some of which have turned into products.

    <h3>Kili - AI powered podcast tool for language learners</h3>
    <p class="tech">Python, PyTorch, NLTK, Go, AWS, Terraform, NextJS</p>
    <p> <a href="https://kili.tarkalabs.com/" target="_blank">kili.tarkalabs.com</a> -
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMMc69Nu-7M" target="_blank">‚ñ∂Ô∏è</a> 
    - Kili is a 
    language learning tool that uses an ensemble of models to help
    you learn new human languages. I wanted to build an AI powered solution
    that does not use the OpenAI APIs.</p>

    <p>I consumed RSS/ATOM feeds to download podcast episodes. I then transcribe the text with whisper. While whisper
    can do translations, I found that the quality of translations was quite poor. So I decided to
    use another model. I also found that whisper does not tokenize sentences properly. So, I 
    reconstructed the sentences from the transcript using a our custom sentence tokenizer
    using NLTK. I then generated sentence embeddings with SBert and indexed them with QDrant.
    I used a model called <span class="mono">flan-t5</span> to generate translations to English, Spanish and German. I also
    found that translating directly from French to German did not lead to good results but using English
    as a bridge language yielded better translations.</p>

    <h3>Isai - Towards better Music Understanding</h3>
    <p class="tech">PyTorch, Gradio, Huggingface Spaces, librosa, Deep Learning</p>
    <p> <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/vagmi/isai" target="_blank">Isai Space</a> - Isai is 
    my experiment with Music Information Retrieval</p>

    <p>I built this space as a proof of concept to showcase that we can leverage ML for powering
    better music search. I have played around with music based models primarily to build CNN based
    classifiers. But this project was really cool. It allowed me to use a pretrained foundation model
    called MERT-95M and then train a lot of smaller models that are just a couple of layers deep to
    perform classification tasks.</p>

    <h3>Semantic Music Search</h3>
    <p class="tech">PyTorch, Transformers, BART, Qdrant, FFMpeg, AWS</p>
    <p>This builds on the learnings of the MIR system.</p>

    <p>I used the last layer of encoder part of the model <a href="https://huggingface.co/seungheondoh/lp-music-caps">LP-Music-Caps</a>. 
    I then applied a mean pooling on the encoder's hidden state to generate semantic 
    encodings for music. This allowed me to perform similarity search on music.</p>
    
    <h2>&gt; Client Projects</h2>
    <h3>Songistry</h3>
    <p class="tech">Product Management, Architecture, Rust, GraphQL, Elastic Search, AWS, Terraform, ffmpeg</p>
    <p>
        Songistry is a sync licensing company that acts as a market place to connect
        music supervisors with catalog owners. In essence it is a music catalog manager
        paired with a powerful search engine to discover and match music. We integrated
        with a 3rd party Music Intelligence service called Cyanite to get music information retrieval
        and music similarity search data. This is what led me to experiment with my own
        MIR and music search implementations.
    </p>
    <h3>Khwale - Consulting CTO</h3>
    <p class="tech">Product Management, Architecture, Partner Management</p>
    <p>
    Khwale is a south african record label looking to build its own distribution platform.
    I worked with the founders to setup the product roadmap and to prioritize the features
    that can be executed by their in-house development team. We also evaluated, third
    party distributors to provide a white label experience for their customers.
    </p>

    <h3>QSR Chain Restaurant - Architecture (Store Platform)</h3>
    <p class="tech">Architecture, Kotlin, Terraform, CircleCI pipelines, Docker, AWS</p>
    <p>
    I worked with a client in the QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) space that
    owns a chain of about 2200 restaurants in the US. They were in the process of
    switching their PoS solution and my team is built a platform that would abstract
    over the current PoS and the new PoS system. I have largely been taking care
    of the platform engineering aspects by setting up CircleCI pipelines, Terraform and 
    terragrunt modules that run on a self-hosted runner on AWS. We used secrets manager and 
    specific task roles to ensure that both the builds and workloads are secure.
    </p>
    <h3>Tunecore - Platform Architecture (Distribution)</h3>
    <p class="tech">Software Architecture, Platform engineering, SRE, Ruby on Rails, Go, PostgreSQL, AWS services</p>
    <p>
      Tunecore helps artists sell their music worldwide. It takes albums and
      singles from artists all around the world and distributes them to over 50
      music stores like Apple, Spotify, Youtube Music, Amazon Music, etc. We
      then process the sales reports and process payouts. It paid out over $1
      billion to artists for the year 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
      I helped them split up a 10-year Rails monolith based on Rails 3 into
      different services. We built the core distribution service into its own
      service on Rails 6. We also split the transcoding piece and moved it to
      AWS lambda. We evaluated AWS elastic transcoder and AWS elemental media
      file convert. We instead used Lambda with a statically compiled FFmpeg
      layer. This approach roughly had a 5x-6x throughput increase over the
      elastic transcoder. We also moved the actual SFTP delivery of the files to
      Go and refactored the job queue to three independent steps. This resulted
      in over 70% reduction in the infrastructure costs for the production
      cluster.
    </p>
    <h3>Klstr</h3>
    <p class="tech">Product Management, Go, Terraform, Kubernetes, Drone.io</p>
    <p>
    Klstr was planned to be a certified CNCF Kubernetes Distribution that
    primarily was targeted at on-prem deployments. We built operators to support
    different application deployment patterns and custom pipelines for supporting
    gitops using Drone. 
    </p>
    <h3>Moove - Location and Clustering services</h3>
    <p class="tech">Software Architecture, Go, Ruby on Rails, Android, React, Google Maps SDK, OSRM</p>
    <p>
      Moove was a startup in India focused on providing transport and employee
      mobility solutions for large software companies. The companies in India
      run various shifts 24/7 and provide pick and drop services for their
      employees. This involved building both the driver and the employee app.
      This is very similar to the Uber app sans the payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core location and the route planning were built with Rails. This was
      inefficient and unreliable. We moved the location service alone to use
      Golang and moved from long polling HTTP endpoints to using websockets. I
      also helped batch calls from the android app to send data efficiently to
      the backend.
    </p>
    <p>
      We moved away from using Google Maps SDK for route planning to using OSRM.
      Google Maps SDK even with its distance matrix endpoints was too slow for
      the scale of Moove. We moved to OSRM for route planning and visualized the
      routes on Google Maps.
    </p>
    <h3>PacketMedia - (SMS Marketing tool)</h3>
    <p class="tech">Golang, Elixir, Phoenix, Postgresql, React</p>
    <p>
      PacketMedia was SMS marketing solution and used a Go service for
      interfacing with SMSC gateways and used a Phoenix app to manage campaigns
      and the CRM dashboard.
    </p>
    <h3>Modus - (Vehicle fleet tracking)</h3>
    <p class="tech">React, Google Maps, Rails, Elixir, Postgres</p>
    <p>
      We used React over a Rails app for vehicle fleet tracking. We used Elixir
      for the location service. The data for locations came from an OBD device
      plugged into the vehicle. The OBD device published the GPS coordinates and
      other telemetry information like acceleration and so on to the location
      gateway.

    <h2>Independent Consultant</h2>
    <p>2013-2014</p>
    <p>
      I was the consulting CTO of Reduce Data and was working building the
      keypass system for Qube cinemas. I also conducted independent workshops
      and trainings on several Javascript frameworks and techniques like Test
      Driven Development.
    </p>
    <h3>Qube Cinemas - Keypass</h3>
    <p class="tech">Node, AngularJS, JS</p>
    <p>
      It was a small microservice and a dashboard app for Qube cinemas to manage
      and pull down keys for the DRM movie projectors.
    </p>
    <h3>CTO, Reduce Data (Ad Tech)</h3>
    <p class="tech">Java, Netty, Clojure, Weka, Ember, Play, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Machine Learning</p>
    <p>
      Built a demand side Real Time Bidding platform. Our campaigns were managed
      with a Java Play app on a PostgreSQL database. Our click stream
      information was stored in Cassandra. I sampled the data and built
      ensemble models on Weka (SGD, Random Forest) to classify potential clicks.
      I used Weka to ensure that the model on inference is very light and runs
      in the process on the hot path for RTB Bidding.

    <h2>Thoughtworks - Lead Consultant</h2>
    <p>2012-2013</p>
    <h3>GruppoPAM - Buyer Dashboard</h3>
    <p class="tech">
      Java/Spring, JDBI, Postgres, Teradata, Rails, jQuery, D3, Marionette
    </p>
    <p>
      We built a buyer performance dashboard for an Italian retail chain. It
      allowed them to view the performance metrics for various lines of products
      over different periods. All the heavy lifting was done by the Teradata and
      the Spring Java layer. Rails was used for preference management and to
      build custom reports. We used D3 for all the data visualization.
    </p>
    <h3>GruppoPAM - Assortment Planning</h3>
    <p class="tech">Clojure, PostgreSQL, Neo4j</p>
    <p>
      This was a microservice that did what-if analysis on different
      profitability profiles based configuration such as logistics, format of
      the store, SKU cluster membership and so on. This generated the assortment
      based on this configuration and projected profitability based on past
      metrics. This was a part of the replatforming efforts. The existing
      solution was written as a series of batch jobs on top of Oracle. It took
      over 6 hours of runtime to expand to the SKU level. Expressing them as a
      series of Graph expansions helped us arrive at the effective assortment
      much faster in the order of seconds. It allowed buyers to quickly create
      multiple what-if scenarios and aid in their contract negotiation
      accordingly.
