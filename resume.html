    <h2 class="glitch">Tarka Labs, A division of Sedin Technologies</h2>
    <p>CTO & Co-founder, 2014-onwards</p>
    <p>
      I‚Äòve built this organization into a vibrant team of 35 members worldwide.
      I hired engineers, designers, product managers and sales both in India and
      Canada. Over these years, I have worked on the following projects as an
      individual contributor. To know more about the portfolio of the projects
      done by Tarka Labs, I‚Äôd recommend that you visit our
      <a href="https://tarkalabs.com/projects/">portfolio page</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Tunecore - Platform Architecture (Distribution)</h3>
    <p>(Ruby on Rails, Go, PostgreSQL, AWS services)</p>
    <p>
      Tunecore helps artists sell their music worldwide. It takes albums and
      singles from artists all around the world and distributes them to over 50
      music stores like Apple, Spotify, Youtube Music, Amazon Music, etc. We
      then process the sales reports and process payouts. It paid out over $1
      billion to artists for the year 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
      I helped them split up a 10-year Rails monolith based on Rails 3 into
      different services. We built the core distribution service into its own
      service on Rails 6. We also split the transcoding piece and moved it to
      AWS lambda. We evaluated AWS elastic transcoder and AWS elemental media
      file convert. We instead used Lambda with a statically compiled FFmpeg
      layer. This approach roughly had a 5x-6x throughput increase over the
      elastic transcoder. We also moved the actual SFTP delivery of the files to
      Go and refactored the job queue to three independent steps. This resulted
      in over 70% reduction in the infrastructure costs for the production
      cluster.
    </p>
    <h3>Klstr</h3>
    <p>(Go, Kubernetes, Drone.io)</p>
    <p>
    Klstr was planned to be a certified CNCF Kubernetes Distribution that
    primarily was targeted at on-prem deployments. We built operators to support
    different application deployment patterns and custom pipelines for supporting
    gitops using Drone. 
    </p>
    <h3>Moove - (Location and Clustering services)</h3>
    <p>(Go, Ruby on Rails, Android, React, Google Maps SDK, OSRM)</p>
    <p>
      Moove was a startup in India focused on providing transport and employee
      mobility solutions for large software companies. The companies in India
      run various shifts 24/7 and provide pick and drop services for their
      employees. This involved building both the driver and the employee app.
      This is very similar to the Uber app sans the payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core location and the route planning were built with Rails. This was
      inefficient and unreliable. We moved the location service alone to use
      Golang and moved from long polling HTTP endpoints to using websockets. I
      also helped batch calls from the android app to send data efficiently to
      the backend.
    </p>
    <p>
      We moved away from using Google Maps SDK for route planning to using OSRM.
      Google Maps SDK even with its distance matrix endpoints was too slow for
      the scale of Moove. We moved to OSRM for route planning and visualized the
      routes on Google Maps.
    </p>
    <h3>PacketMedia - (SMS Marketing tool)</h3>
    <p>(Golang, Elixir, Phoenix, Postgresql, React)</p>
    <p>
      PacketMedia was SMS marketing solution and used a Go service for
      interfacing with SMSC gateways and used a Phoenix app to manage campaigns
      and the CRM dashboard.
    </p>
    <h3>Modus - (Vehicle fleet tracking)</h3>
    <p>(React, Google Maps, Rails, Elixir, Postgres)</p>
    <p>
      We used React over a Rails app for vehicle fleet tracking. We used Elixir
      for the location service. The data for locations came from an OBD device
      plugged into the vehicle. The OBD device published the GPS coordinates and
      other telemetry information like acceleration and so on to the location
      gateway.

    <h2>Independent Consultant</h2>
    <p>2013-2014</p>
    <p>
      I was the consulting CTO of Reduce Data and was working building the
      keypass system for Qube cinemas. I also conducted independent workshops
      and trainings on several Javascript frameworks and techniques like Test
      Driven Development.
    </p>
    <h3>Qube Cinemas - Keypass</h3>
    <p>(Node, AngularJS, JS)</p>
    <p>
      It was a small microservice and a dashboard app for Qube cinemas to manage
      and pull down keys for the DRM movie projectors.
    </p>
    <h3>CTO, Reduce Data (Ad Tech)</h3>
    <p>(Java, Netty, Clojure, Weka, Ember, Play, PostgreSQL, Cassandra)</p>
    <p>
      Built a demand side Real Time Bidding platform. Our campaigns were managed
      with a Java Play app on a PostgreSQL database. Our click stream
      information was stored in Cassandra. We sampled the data and built
      ensemble models on Weka (SGD, Random Forest) to classify potential clicks.
      We used Weka to ensure that the model on inference is very light and runs
      in the process.

    <h2>Thoughtworks - Lead Consultant</h2>
    <p>2012-2013</p>
    <h3>GruppoPAM - Buyer Dashboard</h3>
    <p>
      (Java/Spring, JDBI, Postgres, Teradata, Rails, jQuery, D3, Marionette)
    </p>
    <p>
      We built a buyer performance dashboard for an Italian retail chain. It
      allowed them to view the performance metrics for various lines of products
      over different periods. All the heavy lifting was done by the Teradata and
      the Spring Java layer. Rails was used for preference management and to
      build custom reports. We used D3 for all the data visualization.
    </p>
    <h3>GruppoPAM - Assortment Planning</h3>
    <p>(Clojure, PostgreSQL, Neo4j)</p>
    <p>
      This was a microservice that did what-if analysis on different
      profitability profiles based configuration such as logistics, format of
      the store, SKU cluster membership and so on. This generated the assortment
      based on this configuration and projected profitability based on past
      metrics. This was a part of the replatforming efforts. The existing
      solution was written as a series of batch jobs on top of Oracle. It took
      over 6 hours of runtime to expand to the SKU level. Expressing them as a
      series of Graph expansions helped us arrive at the effective assortment
      much faster in the order of seconds. It allowed buyers to quickly create
      multiple what-if scenarios and aid in their contract negotiation
      accordingly.

      training workshops.
